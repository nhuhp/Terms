PAE - Physical Address Extension is a technology which allows 32 bit operating systems to use up to 64 Gb of memory (RAM), something which is normally achieved by switching to a 64 bit system.
PAE kernels give you the feature of 64 bit systems (the ability to use >3.2gb of RAM)
Where the generic kernel with 32 bit cant.
